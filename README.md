# Graduation Projects

### Notes
- Two teams have contacted Eng. Omar
- And only one team has contacted Eng. Mai.
```diff
+ The missed project team members should contact Eng. Mai and send their work.
- Eng. Mai and Eng Omar put degrees for those who work with them.
```
- I **think** the missed project is the Currency Vision for Visually Impaired.
